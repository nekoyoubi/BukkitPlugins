This project will be the new home of any and all Bukkit plugin work that I do. Branches
of the packages under this project to their respective plugins is obviously perfectly
fine, but I needed to consolidate the Bukkit repos (due to the migration to IntelliJ), so
here we are. Feel free to do with this project or any of its sub-projects as you will.

More information about these plugins may be found in their respective dev.bukkit.org
pages, at nekoyoubi.com, or stitchgaming.com depending.

These projects are developed with IntelliJ IDEA, and0 may contain meta files and
folder structures as such.
