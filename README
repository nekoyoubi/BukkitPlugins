This project will be the new home of any and all Bukkit plugin work that I do. Branches
of the packages under this project to their respective plugins is obviously perfectly
fine, but I needed to consolidate the Bukkit repos (due to the migration to IntelliJ), so
here we are. Feel free to do with this project or any of its sub-projects as you will.

More information about these plugins may be found in their respective dev.bukkit.org
pages, at nekoyoubi.com, or stitchgaming.com depending.
