Overview
========
StitchCraft is a set of changes that, while they don't warrant their own plugins, are used on the [Stitch Gaming](http://stitchgaming.com) Minecraft server.

Features
======
* Toggleable automatic torch placement when light-level drops low enough (and torches are in inventory).
* Placing sand on (or adjacent to) lava will instantly turn the sand into glass.

Usage
======

Automatic Torches
----------------------
Type `/autotorch` or `/at` to enable/disable automatic torch placement. Optionally, you can specify a number that represents the minimum light level before placing a torch (default is 7). The higher the number, the more often torches will be placed; the lower, the further between.

Sand-to-Glass
-----------------
Just place sand into lava as you normally would. Instead of sinking or sitting stationary, the sand will instantly turn into glass.
